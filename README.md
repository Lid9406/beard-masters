This is project is created for the purposes of attempting to create a Python implementation that could potentially be used in a real-world scenario as practice in both creating, organizing, testing, and implementing Python code modules and all the the things that might be normally included in a basic coding project. 
So, it is not only demonstrating programming in Python and gaining some familiarity with the programming language itself, but also demonstrating and gaining experience in planning, organizing, creating a repository (the potential for collaborative projects), and working through the problems and finding solutions while setting it all up.
I am learning that there is a ton more that goes into developing, even a simple program, than I might have originally figured. Now I am starting to understand why there's a "ReadMe" file with just about every program I've ever downloaded, and not only that GitHub is a platform that utilizes "Git" and is part of a whole system and community built around organizing and collaboration in the field of computer programming (it's not just a place to download "free software"  LOL)
